description: When we imagine establishing contact with an alien race, we usually assume
  that the interstellar interlopers would be light-years ahead of us in terms of technological
  sophistication. But what if our new alien acquaintances were astoundingly average
  in their appearance and intellect? That's the premise of "The Invaders," a tale
  from Murray Leinster that puts a new spin on the first contact genre of science
  fiction.
